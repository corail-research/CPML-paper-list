# Overview
This repository aims to serve as a (hopefully) comprehensive list of publications related to the integration of Constraint Programming (CP) and Machine Learning (ML). It accompanies the survey paper "Combining Constraint Programming and Machine Learning: From Current Progress to Future Opportunities" (JAIR, 2025).

# Contributing
The initial set of references corresponds to those discussed in Section 3 of the survey. Over time, we hope the repository evolves into a living collection that reflects the growing body of research in this area.
We encourage the community to contribute new references via pull requests. Contribution guidelines are provided below.

# Paper list

All related references are listed following the template below:

```
[<Venue>'<Year>] <Title of the paper>

When available, a direct link to the paper is also provided. The structure of this repository mirrors the organization used in the survey paper.
