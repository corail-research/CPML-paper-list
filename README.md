# Overview
This repository aims to serve as a (hopefully) comprehensive list of publications related to the integration of Constraint Programming (CP) and Machine Learning (ML). It accompanies the survey paper "Combining Constraint Programming and Machine Learning: From Current Progress to Future Opportunities" (JAIR, 2025).

# Contributing
The initial set of references corresponds to those discussed in Section 3 of the survey. Over time, we hope the repository evolves into a living collection that reflects the growing body of research in this area.
We encourage the community to contribute new references via pull requests. Contribution guidelines are provided below:

1. **Scope:** Only include methods that combine both Constraint Programming (CP) and Machine Learning (ML) within the same pipeline.
2. **Format:** Add your entry in the correct section of the repository and follow the template below.
3. **Pull Request:** Open a pull request with a clear title (e.g., Add [Venue'Year] Title). In the PR description, include 1–2 short paragraphs explaining why this paper belongs to the CP+ML field.


# Format of references

All related references are listed following the template below:

```
[<Venue>'<Year>] <Title of the paper>
```

When available, a direct link to the paper is also provided. The structure of this repository mirrors the organization used in the survey paper.
